## About Me 👱‍♀️

I’m a growing data analyst passionate about helping businesses achieve smarter growth through confident, data-driven decisions.

With a calm, analytical mindset guided by integrity, I transform complex data into clear, actionable insights. Helping businesses save time, boost productivity, and improve operational efficiency - so they can focus on what matters most.

I’ve developed skills in Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, and Python through the Africa Agility Foundation, where I collaborated on the FarmFoodHub project; a farm-to-table initiative connecting farmers directly to consumers, NGOs, and food banks. This experience allowed me to apply data analysis to a real-world problem and contribute to SDG Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).

My background in customer service has shaped me into a communicator who explains insights in simple, relatable ways for stakeholders. I believe data isn’t just about numbers, it’s about people, decisions, and creating meaningful impact.

I’m excited to work with startups and businesses that value data as a driver for growth, rather than relying solely on gut feeling. I’m also committed to continuous learning and growth as a professional.
