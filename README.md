Data Analyst | Turning Complex Data into Clear Insights | Increasing Productivity & Saving Time | EXCEL | SQL | POWER BI

## About Me 

Iâ€™m a growing data analyst passionate about helping businesses achieve smarter growth through confident, data-driven decisions.

With a calm, analytical mindset guided by integrity, I transform complex data into clear, actionable insights. Helping businesses save time, boost productivity, and improve operational efficiency - so they can focus on what matters most.

Iâ€™ve developed skills in Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, and Python through the Africa Agility Foundation, where I collaborated on the FarmFoodHub project; a farm-to-table initiative connecting farmers directly to consumers, NGOs, and food banks. This experience allowed me to apply data analysis to a real-world problem and contribute to SDG Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).

My background in customer service has shaped me into a communicator who explains insights in simple, relatable ways for stakeholders. I believe data isnâ€™t just about numbers, itâ€™s about people, decisions, and creating meaningful impact.

Iâ€™m excited to work with startups and businesses that value data as a driver for growth, rather than relying solely on gut feeling. Iâ€™m also open to volunteer opportunities and internships that will help me continue learning, gain hands-on experience, and grow as a professional.

Letâ€™s connect if you share the same interest for using data to make meaningful change!
